## Assignments:
- Describe in detail what is Cloud Computing and its types.
- Use software virtualization in Your Host Operating System to install guest operating systems.
- State which type of Cloud AWS is. Create an account on AWS and understand dashboard of AWS.
- Installation of The AWS CLI using credentials and roles.
- Create your first instance on AWS using AWS dashboard and AWS command-line.
- Launch the first elastic compute cloud instance via two methods: using program and using AWS CLI.
- Create put and get request using API of Amazon S3. Also store the data into S3 & fetch and delete using command line and programming.
- Detect type of instance using amazon programming API. Also print on screen roles of IAM server in life cycle of IAM.
- Create your own VPC. Also select your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. In the end, launch EC2 instance in it.
- Create EC2 instances and manage load in such a way that new instance get created as soon as application load increases.
