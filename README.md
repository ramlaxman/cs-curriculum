# CS Curriculum

This curriculum is designed as per my understanding of Computer Science and Engineering.

Many would argue that it is not following standard like academicians and developers path in traditional manner. 

And that is actually where it differs. This curriculum reflects:

- How I learn each subject
- What are my interpretations
- How much do I understand it [REALLY].
